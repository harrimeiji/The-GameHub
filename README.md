# The-GameHub

This code is something I am working on as like a text base python game to play in terminal.

This is also a way to document my steps and so people know I did it because I intend to make it massive and hopefully fun.
I made this code to practise and to learn certain features of python.



When running, each action/game requires a re-run, for example after completing a game and saving, you would have to re-run to check the leaderboards.
